Here's what I've learned in this project
- I've learned to use structs and how to manage data within them
- I've begun to learn about returning values, though I have more to learn about expressions and statements
- I've become more comfortable using match statements, they're starting to become second nature
- I've gained more of an ease writing code in general, I have more of a sense of understanding what's going on and not feeling so lost reading and writing it
